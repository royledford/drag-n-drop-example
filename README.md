# Drag and Drop Example

This is an example of using HTML5 drag and drop in a React app.

See this [awesome article](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/the-future-of-drag-and-drop-apis-249dfea7a15f) on Medium by
Dan Abramov on some of the challenges to using the HTML5 drag and drop API. Basically explains a number of pitfalls to
the native implementation. We should all just use [React DnD](http://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/) and not try to go
into the deep dark forest alone, lol.

This has an implementation based on [this tutorial](http://webcloud.se/sortable-list-component-react-js/) by
[Daniel Stocks](http://webcloud.se/)
